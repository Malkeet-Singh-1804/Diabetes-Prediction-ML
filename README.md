# Diabetes-Prediction-ML
Predicts diabetes using ML.
# Diabetes Prediction System 🩺

## 📌 Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on various medical features. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare using data-driven methods.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (from Kaggle or UCI Repository)
- **Features**:
  - Pregnancies
  - Glucose
  - Blood Pressure
  - Skin Thickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI
  - Diabetes Pedigree Function
  - Age
- **Target**:
  - 0: Non-diabetic
  - 1: Diabetic

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed analysis and visualization to:
- Handle missing data
- Identify feature correlations
- Understand data distributions using plots (histograms, heatmaps, pairplots)

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### 🧪 Model Evaluation
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- ROC-AUC Score

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📈 Results
- Achieved up to **X% accuracy** on test data.
- Random Forest showed the best performance among all models.
